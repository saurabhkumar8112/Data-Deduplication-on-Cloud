# Data-Deduplication-on-Cloud

From the results so obtained from the project, we can clearly see the trade-off between the
deduplication efficiency and the computation time. In practice as a client point of view we want that
our computation time should be small, but we also want that our storage should be used efficiently.
So we can conclude for the company point of view where the efficiency and time both matters, we
can use the extreme binning algorithm. This algorithm performs well even if we have prefixes as this
uses the variable length chunking.
